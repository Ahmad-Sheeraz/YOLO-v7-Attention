# Attention based YOLOv7 for Gastric Lesion Detection (Master's project)

*YOLOv7 & SE Attention Module Integration*

-We developed an automated gastric lesion detector using an enhanced YOLO-v7 object detection algorithm for effectively identifying gastric lesions, including non-cancerous, pre-cancerous, and cancerous cases.
-By integrating the Squeeze and Excitation attention module into the networkâ€™s backbone architecture, we substantially enhance the identification of small-sized lesions. 


## Data

Dataset: Used private dataset total amount of around 60k samples. The classes included Cancer, Adenoma, Ulcer and Normal cases.

## Architecture
The architecture is based on YOLOv7 with the modification in the backbone architecture by intergrating Squeeze & Excitation attention module.
